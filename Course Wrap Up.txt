Congratulations on completing,
and thank you for taking this course, AWS Fundamentals:
Going Cloud Native. We covered a lot of territory. We started with an introduction
to AWS services, and then explored AWS Regions and
infrastructure. Next, we focused on some fundamental
AWS services in the areas of compute, networking, storage, databases,
monitoring, and scaling. We finished up with an overview
of security and cost management. So you may be asking,
where do I go from here? Throughout the course, we have provided
links to AWS documentation and resources. The best way to further your
understanding of these services is to get hands-on experience. Please take advantage of
the AWS Free Tier and jump in. This is the first class in an ongoing
series of classes we are creating on Coursera. This class utilized
server-based solutions, and our next class will focus
on serverless solutions. Specifically, we will look at
services, such as AWS Lambda, to create on-demand compute services without
having to manage and maintain servers. In later classes, we will dive deeper into
some of the topics we discussed in this class, such as security and
database services. Please stay tuned for details. On behalf of Blaine, Morgan, and
our lizard friend, thank you for taking our class. We hope you've learned some new things and
enjoyed our time together. Now little one, let's go find our buddies. [MUSIC]
