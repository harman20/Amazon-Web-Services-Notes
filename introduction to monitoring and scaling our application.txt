It's me, Allen, again. To recap, in the last module, we focused on database services on AWS. We looked at running your own database on top of EC2, and we explored Amazon RDS, and Amazon DynamoDB. In this module, we'll turn our attention to scalability. One of the great things about running your application on AWS is the ability to right-size your resources. Adding and expanding to them, when demand warrants, and as importantly, reducing capacity as demand declines, to reduce cost. To do this, we need to understand what is happening with our application. How it is performing, and how it utilizes resources. Morgan will begin this module with a discussion of our monitoring tool, Amazon CloudWatch. Blaine will then look at load balancing, and both he and Morgan will demonstrate how auto scaling works. You guessed it, like in the prior modules, we will have resources and quizzes to keep you on the right track. Let's get started with Module 4.
