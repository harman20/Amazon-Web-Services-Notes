Welcome back. Blaine here. We've covered a lot about storage so far. We've talked about block storage with EBS that attaches directly to EC2 instances. We've talked about objects store like S3, or even Glacier that allows us to store single objects in a regional distribution. Sometimes you might have a slightly different block storage need, where you need to have a single store of, let's say, a shared file system that maybe multiple EC2 instances need to connect to. Remember, EBS only attaches to one EC2 at a time. Introducing Elastic File System, or EFS, and the elastic file system for AWS EFS is designed to be a regionally distributed, meaning it doesn't live inside any one subnet, a regionally distributed file store that can automatically attach to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously, many EC2 instances, including the instances in different VPCs. This way, if you need a corporate directory, a corporate file store where everyone connects to the same document store, EFS can be that solution for you. In fact, using EFS File Sync, you can even have that directory connect to your on-premises data center, allowing your people at your home network to think they're connecting to home directories when really they're being stored inside EFS on AWS, with all the security and regional distribution that comes automatically.
