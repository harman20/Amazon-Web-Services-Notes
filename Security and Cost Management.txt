Yes. Allen again. Welcome to the last module of Going Cloud Native on AWS. You're almost done. After the last module, where we discussed monitoring and scaling, we now have a robust application that is almost ready to be rolled out. But before we do that, we have a couple of important topics to discuss. Security is of utmost importance here at AWS. Blaine will review our shared security model. When I was a technical trainer, one of the first questions I was asked when introducing AWS to customers was, "How much is this going to cost?" Morgan will look at some of the tools AWS offers to help manage and understand costs. Finally, I will have a brief preview of some future offerings in this AWS Fundamentals series on Coursera. Once again, like in prior modules, we'll have some resources associated with each of these topics, as well as quizzes, and in this case, a final exam to wrap up. Let's get started with Module 5.
