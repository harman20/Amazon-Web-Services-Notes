Allen again. In the last module, we looked at networking and storage. We configured the VPC, saw how we could store images and other objects in S3, and used EBS and EFS for block storage. Now, in this module, we're going to discuss how to run relational and NoSQL databases on AWS. Blaine will first look at simply running your own database on top of EC2, much like you would on-premise. Then, he'll introduce you to the Amazon Relational Database Service, or RDS. RDS is a managed database service where you can pick amongst popular database engines and let AWS manage your database for you. Next, Morgan will demonstrate Amazon DynamoDB. DynamoDB is a managed NoSQL database that, depending upon your application, may be a better solution than a traditional SQL-based database. As in the prior modules, we'll have some resources and quizzes associated with each of these topics to keep you on the right track. Let's get started with Module 3.
